`hellbinder` provides O/RM for Android's [content providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html)

## About

`hellbinder` uses annotations to generate all the boilerplate code necessary to
extract data from a content provider. This decision was made to avoid the
performance cost of reflection.

Please note that `hellbinder` is still in a very preliminary stage.
